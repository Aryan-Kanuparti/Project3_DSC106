Rhythms of Heat: Interactive Analysis of Male and Female Mouse Body Temperature Across Ovulation Cycles

Research Question and Audience
Our visualization is designed for researchers, students, and data enthusiasts interested in biological rhythms and sex-based physiological differences. It allows users to explore how ovulation affects body temperature in female mice and how these patterns compare to male temperature fluctuations. By structuring the data into a clear 24-hour cycle while also providing the option to view individual days, our visualization helps users identify key trends and investigate specific days in greater detail.
This visualization helps answer important research questions, such as how ovulation influences the body temperature of female mice, how male and female mice differ in temperature fluctuations throughout the day, and whether certain time periods show more pronounced differences between groups. Users might discover that female mice tend to have higher body temperatures than males, with the difference becoming even more distinct during ovulation. By computing averages rather than relying on individual raw readings, we highlight persistent trends while still allowing users to explore daily variations.


Design Rationale
To enhance the clarity of these insights, we made several design choices. Our approach to data aggregation involved taking the mean temperature for each hour across the 14-day period, providing a general trend without excessive noise. However, to allow more flexibility, we included a dropdown feature that enables users to select and visualize individual days instead of just the aggregated 24-hour cycle. This allows for deeper exploration of daily variations, including identifying potential outliers or patterns that might not be apparent in the averaged data. The dropdown also highlights which days correspond to ovulation, helping users compare ovulating and non-ovulating days with male and female temperature averages derived from 13 subjects per group.
The color palette and visual encoding were chosen to improve readability and interpretation. Blue represents males, while red represents all females, maintaining a clear and familiar contrast. Ovulating females are represented in purple as an intermediary between red and blue, emphasizing their distinct trends. Interactivity was a key focus to ensure usability and engagement. A line plot was chosen as it best captures continuous temperature fluctuations over time. Users can toggle specific groups using an interactive legend, making it easier to isolate particular trends. The dropdown menu allows users to select specific days for closer examination, helping them compare daily fluctuations with the aggregated view. A time slider further enhances exploration by allowing users to pan through different hours of the day, making it easier to observe when temperature differences are most pronounced. Additionally, hover tooltips provide precise temperature values, offering detailed insights into the data.


Development Process & Technical Challenges
The development process involved three key phases: brainstorming and planning, implementation and debugging, and validation and refinement. The brainstorming phase was particularly involved, as we had to decide whether to focus on temperature or activity, determine how to structure the data for effective visualization, and explore different ways of presenting trends. While we initially considered heatmaps and box plots, the line plot provided the clearest representation of temperature variations over time.
The implementation phase required extensive work with D3.js to handle data binding, plotting, and interactivity. Aggregating data into a 24-hour cycle presented challenges in aligning timestamps, and integrating the dropdown feature required structuring the dataset in a way that allowed seamless switching between the averaged and unaggregated views. Debugging interactive elements such as the legend, dropdown, and time slider was particularly time-intensive, as toggling one feature sometimes interfered with the others.
During the validation and refinement phase, we compared the processed data against raw values to ensure accuracy. User feedback helped refine the dropdown functionality, ensuring it was intuitive and clearly labeled ovulation days. We also adjusted the color scheme and tooltip placement based on feedback to improve readability and reduce visual clutter.


Team Collaboration & Lessons Learned
Our team collaborated effectively by dividing responsibilities between data processing, visualization development, and user experience testing. We communicated primarily through GitHub and text messaging, allowing us to quickly discuss issues and iterate on improvements. Version control through Git helped us manage different iterations of the visualization without overwriting progress. In hindsight, we would allocate more time for early prototyping, as some late-stage design changes required significant restructuring. Additionally, improved documentation would make it easier for others to modify or build upon our work in the future.
We all worked on brainstorming together and all of us contributed to the coding implementation as well. Working concurrently as well as consecutively thanks to Github. Additionally, improved documentation would make it easier for others to modify or build upon our work in the future. The brainstorming took roughly 3-4 people hours and the implementation took around 5-6. Debugging d3 code and deciding on our general focus took the longest time, other than that, all other steps took roughly an equal amount of time.
To ensure accessibility for potential non-technical users, we provided clear labels and tooltips, including a default state highlighting key trends. Discussion among the group helped refine the dropdown feature, ensuring that selecting individual days was intuitive and informative. The ability to compare specific days against the aggregated trends proved useful for identifying day-to-day variations.


Conclusion & Future Improvements
Our visualization offers a powerful way to explore biological temperature rhythms and ovulation-related differences, helping researchers investigate trends in thermoregulation. While we successfully implemented interactive features and clear data aggregation, future improvements could include additional interactivity such as user-defined filtering, statistical overlays for more detailed comparisons, and more mathematically sound aggregation methods that don't pick up as much noise. The ability to customize the time range instead of viewing only the full 24-hour cycle could further enhance user exploration. By designing a flexible and interactive visualization, we empower users to engage with the data dynamically, uncovering trends that might not be immediately visible in raw datasets.
